                <p>My name is Tai. I was born in Vietnam and lived there for about 13 years. In 2008, I moved to the United States with my family. It was a culture shock for me since I barely spoke any English. I spent the first two years learning English. In 2015, I graduted from Lincoln High School and got accepted into UCR. After 4 years has passed, I graduted with a B.A in Business Economics.</p>
                <p>I have been looking a job since summer but I haven't found any. So I decided to join coding bootcamp at UCB Extension with the hope to increase job opportunities.</p>
                <P>I like to hangout with friends and play</P>
